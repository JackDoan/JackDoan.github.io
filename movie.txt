CHARLOTTE and RYAN are finishing lunch at a casual restaurant. The restaurant is well lit and it's a very happy environment. The couple is joyous. It is obvious that they are very close. Charlotte checks the time.

Charlotte

Ah, babe I've gotta run. I've got my friend's party later and I still haven't gotten her a present.

The couple heads out of the restaurant.

Ryan
Oh okay. Well, have fun! Will I see you tonight?

CHARLOTTE

Yeah, I'll stop by tonight.

They share a kiss on the cheek.

Ryan

Okay, I love you!

Charlotte rushes to her car.

CHARLOTTE

Love you too!

Ryan laughs at his girlfriend's frantic running and heads to his car.

Charlotte is looking around in the store for a present. She walks around and finally picks up a novelty gift. At checkout she notices a man, her age, buying odd things, including a flashlights and plastic bags.

CHARLOTTE

What's all that for?

The man flips his head to look at her, flustered someone had asked him that. He pauses.

Vince

My car broke down. I'm not sure what's wrong, so I'm going to need a flashlight to see under the hood.

Genuinely curious, Charlotte continues their conversation while she's checked out.

CHARLOTTE

What happens if you don't figure it out?

VINCE
No idea. Don't have anyone to bring me home.
CHARLOTTE

Oh, well I don't know much about cars, but I can take you home if you'd like. My car's just outside. I...

VINCE interrupts her.

Vince
You would? Really? That'd be great.

Charlotte motions to her car.

CHARLOTTE

Yeah, come on.

They get to the car.

VINCE

How about I drive? I know a shortcut.

CHARLOTTE

You sure?

Charlotte doesn't think it's too bad of an idea because she has a soft spot for people in trouble. He looks her age, so why not?

VINCE

Yeah, it'll be easy for both of us.

CHARLOTTE

Yeah, okay. What could go wrong?

Charlotte laughs. Charlotte's excited of the possibility of a new friend and it doesn't hurt that he's attractive. Charlotte throws him the keys and gets in the passenger seat.

INT. Charlotte's Car, Country Roads

Vince and Charlotte have ventured out onto unfamiliar roads.

CHARLOTTE

Where are we?

Vince

It's part of the shortcut!

Charlotte

Okay, okay.

The odd roads makes Charlotte a little suspicious so she goes through her purse searching for something she could use if this guy isn't who he seems to be. She finds a bottle of perfume as they pull up to a neighborhood.

EXt. Vince's House

They make it to his house.

CHARLOTTE

Whoa, nice house.

Vince

Oh come on, I don't look poor, do I?

Charlotte nervously laughs and opens her door. Vince meets her at the door and covers her head with a black bag. Charlotte passes out.

Charlotte wakes up in what appears to be a child's room. She has no idea what's going on. She looks around frantically. She tiptoes to the door and sees through the crack that Vince is outside keeping watch on the room. Freaked out, she crawls to the window and sees her car. She opens the window and gets on the windowsill. Vince hears her and opens the door. She jumps. Vince runs downstairs.

<p scenestr="6" scenenumber="6" id="3jbP8ea0" class="sceneheading">EXT. Vince's HOUSE, YArd

Charlotte stumbles to get up. Vince meets her halfway to her car, grabs her wrist and drags her inside.

Charlotte

What are you doing? LET ME GO!

Vince

Shut up.

CHARLOTTE

LET ME GO! AH! SOMEONE HELP!

Vince

SHUT. UP!
They get inside and Charlotte still tries to escape. She sees in the entrance a childhood picture of her boyfriend. She immediately stops resisting.
VINCE

Maybe this room will teach you not to defy me.
Vince shoves Charlotte into a closet sized room and locks it with a chair.
<p scenestr="7" scenenumber="7" id="78dQeo40" class="sceneheading">INt. Ryan's House
Ryan is beside himself because of his girlfriend's disappearance. He's on the couch mindlessly watching the news. They start talking about his girlfriend, so he turns it up.
Reporter

Eighteen year old girl, recently identified as Charlotte Huber, reported missing as of 2:53PM yesterday. Last seen with a seemingly white male. The police have provided this sketch of the suspect based on surveillance footage from Target on Legacy and Eldorado, where the girl was last seen.

Ryan pauses the TV on the surveillance footage, takes a picture and rushes out the door, leaving the TV on.

REPORTER

If you see her or have a tip, call 214-714-8229.
<p scenestr="8" scenenumber="8" id="MsfQ88b0" class="sceneheading">EXT. store
Ryan arrives at the store and tries to reenact the photos from the news. He sees a car in the parking lot that matches a car in the photos. He rushes over to it and tries not to look suspicious. Looking inside the car, he notices keys inside. He doubts the car will open, but tries anyway. To his surprise, the car door opens, so he sits in the driver's seat and turns on the car. Ryan notices there's an address on the keys.
<p scenestr="9" scenenumber="9" id="fghQhlc0" class="sceneheading">Int. Second Room
Charlotte is sitting in a ball in the smaller room. Vinces comes in, turns on the light, and slams the door. Standing over her, he starts to ask questions.

VINCE

Why'd you try to leave?

Charlotte looks around nervously.

CHARLOTTE

Why'd you kidnap me?

Vince nudges her with his foot.

VINCE
I asked you a question.

CHARLOTTE

I need to go back to him.

VINCE

To who?

CHARLOTTE

Ryan.
Vince flinches at his name.

Vince

And you love this Ryan?

CHARLOTTE

Yeah. I do. Based on that picture, seems like you do too.

VINCE

That's the only memory I have of him.

Charlotte

You know him?

VINCE

Knew him.

CHARLOTTE

So what? You're obsessed?

VINCE

DO NOT SAY THAT WORD!

CHARLOTTE

Obsessed?
Vince releases his anger on the wall, banging it with every word he says.

VINCE

DON'T. SAY. THAT. WORD.
Vince leaves the room angrily and shuts the door.
<p scenestr="10" scenenumber="10" id="AjiQjf30" class="sceneheading">Ext. park

Ryan walks out of the car to the park.

Ryan

CHARLOTTE!?
He walks further down.

Ryan

CHARLOTTE? Char?

Ryan puts his face in his hands like he's giving up. When he looks back up he sees a toy on the ground. He goes to pick it up and sees his name on the tag. Recognizing it, he remembers his childhood best friend.

Ryan

Vince.

It's as if he's watching a younger version of the two boys on the park. The younger boys run down a hill. Ryan gets back in the car and follows the path the two boys took as children. He arrives at the house he lived in as a child.
<p scenestr="11" scenenumber="11" id="iPjQl0f0" class="sceneheading">EXT. Vince's HOUSE
Vince sees Ryan approaching the house and opens the door.

Ryan

WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!?

VINCE

Nice to see you too.

Ryan

Where is she?

VINCE

Charlotte?

Ryan

Yes, Charlotte! Where is she?
Vince

Inside.
Ryan tries to run inside. Vince stops him with his arm.

Vince

You'll see her soon. I promise.
Ryan

Is she okay?

VINCE

Yes.

Ryan

Did you hurt her?

Vince

No.
Ryan, confused, takes a step back.

Ryan

Then why'd you do it?

VINCE

You.

Ryan

Vince, cut the crap. Just let me see her.
Vince

AREN'T YOU HAPPY TO SEE ME!?

Ryan

YOU KIDNAPPED MY GIRLFRIEND. I'm not too happy about that!

VINCE

But we're friends. We're best friends.

Ryan

We haven't talked since middle school. We're not friends, Vince. Just let me see Charlotte!

Vince

We're not friends...

Vince nods repeatedly trying to cope with the news that Ryan is not really his friend.
Vince

We're not friends.

Ryan

We're not friends, no. Now let me see Charlotte.

Vince opens the door to where Charlotte is. Vince pulls a gun to his head (implied).

Ryan

NO! NO! Vince that's not okay! Stop!
Vince pulls the trigger and falls to the floor.

Ryan

We're friends.
Charlotte runs out of the room and tackles Ryan in a hug. Ryan is equally as relieved to see Charlotte as he is distraught by Vince's death. He pulls out his phone, calls 911 and sirens are heard.
